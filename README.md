EKTweener

http://edankwan.github.com/EKTweener.js/

EKTweener is a simple tweening library for use in Javascript using the style like Tweener and TweenMax in Flash. It is simple but powerful to handle the transitions of plain object or DOM elements.

I was a Flash developer and now nearly 100% of my work involves HTML/CSS/JS. I got so used to using Tweener and TweenMax in Flash and created EKTweener using the similar structure like:
```js
    EKTweener.to(element, duration, { property: options });
```
